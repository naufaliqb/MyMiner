##### JavaScript Monero miners are scripts designed to mine the cryptocurrency Monero (XMR) using the processing power of visitors' web browsers without their explicit consent. This practice is commonly referred to as "cryptojacking." Here's a brief overview.

<p> >_ <b>Cryptojacking:</b> It involves embedding scripts in websites or ads that use visitors' computational resources to mine cryptocurrencies. In the context of Monero, this is done because Monero is designed to be mined using consumer-grade hardware, making it suitable for browser-based mining.</p>

<p> >_ <b>JavaScript:</b> Most cryptojacking scripts use JavaScript, a programming language commonly supported by web browsers. The scripts are usually hidden within the code of a website and run on visitors' devices when they access the site.</p>

<p> >_ <b>Monero (XMR)</b>: Monero is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency known for its anonymity features. It is often preferred for browser-based mining due to its ASIC-resistant nature, making it more accessible for individuals with standard computer hardware.</p>
